The user should register into the app and add information on the profile as described below, the user has the option to add pictures to follow the lost weight progress, we will keep a record of all pictures from day 1 to last, based on the user profile the app will suggest a daily calories amount, for that weâ€™ll scrape information from https://www.calculator.net/calorie-calculator.html, to store the info we can use mongoDB and firebase to upload the pictures.</p>
